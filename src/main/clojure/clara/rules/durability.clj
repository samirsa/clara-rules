  "Provides the ability to serialize and deserialize a session.  Options can be given and supported
   via the opts argument to both serialize and deserialize.  Certain options are expected and 
   required to be supported by any implementation of ISessionSerializer.  These are referred to as 
   the 'standard' options. 
   
   These include:

   * :rulebase-only? - When true indicates the rulebase is the only part of the session to serializer.
     The *default* is false for the serialize-session-state function.  It is defaulted to true for the
     serialize-rulebase convenience function.  This is useful for when many sessions are to be
     serialized, but all having a common rulebase.  Storing the rulebase only, will likely save both
     space and time in these scenarios.

   * :with-rulebase? - When true the rulebase is included in the serialized state of the session.  
     The *default* behavior is false when serializing a session via the serialize-session-state function.

   * :base-rulebase - A rulebase to attach to the session being deserialized.  The assumption here is that
     the session was serialized without the rulebase, i.e. :with-rulebase? = false, so it needs a rulebase
     to be 'attached' back onto it to be usable.

   * :forms-per-eval - The maximum number of expressions that will be evaluated per call to eval.
     Larger batch sizes should see better performance compared to smaller batch sizes.
     Defaults to 5000, see clara.rules.compiler/forms-per-eval-default for more information.

   Options for the rulebase semantics that are documented at clara.rules/mk-session include:

   * :fact-type-fn
   * :ancestors-fn
   * :activation-group-sort-fn
   * :activation-group-fn
