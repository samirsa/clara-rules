  is not intended to have a precise meaning, and is intended solely as a means
  to provide a rough guide to which rules and queries should be considered
  the first suspects when diagnosing  performance problems in rules sessions.
  It is possible for a relatively small number of interactions to take a long
  time if those interactions are particularly costly.  It is expected that
  the results may change between different versions when Clara's internals change,
  for example to optimize the rules network.  Nevertheless, it is anticipated
  that this will provide useful information for a first pass at rules
  performance problem debugging.  This should not be used to drive user logic.

  This currently returns a Clojure array map in order to conveniently have the rules
  with the most interactions printed first in the string representation of the map."
